Hammer Readme
==============

Building
--------
JDK 1.5 or greater required

Unix: ./build.sh all
Win:    Somebody write one!

The build can also be run from IntelliJ by running the 'all' run
configuration. See below for Intellij config files.

IntelliJ
--------
Intellij project files can be found in config/intellij. Copy them to the
root directory and your're ready to go. If you have commit access, please
don't check them into the project root.

To update the settings:
1. svn up
2. Quit Intellij.
3. cp config/intellij/hammer.i* .
4. Change the settings in IntelliJ.
5. Quit Intellij.
6. cp hammer.i* config/intellij
7. svn ci -m'Updated intellij settings'

Documentation
-------------
* Simple examples of use can be found in src/demo.
* The Hammer build in src/build is the best place to go for more complex
* examples.
* See the Hammer wiki at http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/hammer for more
  info.

Layout
------
* All source files are split up into their components under the 'src' dir.
* All generated files including class files go into the 'gen' directory.
  This directory is deleted by the 'clean' target.
* The hammer.jar is the one you will need in your own projects. It can be
  found with the other jars in the 'gen/artifacts/jars/' directory.
* All Hammer dependent jars are located under the 'lib' directory.
  The quality related tols jars such as junit, jmock, simian jars are *not*
  required for running Hammer in your project unless your code depends on
  them.
