Hammer Readme
==============

Building
--------
JDK 6 or greater required.

Unix: ./build.sh
Win:    Somebody write one!

The build can also be run from IntelliJ by running the 'all' run
configuration. See below for Intellij config files.

IntelliJ
--------
Intellij project files can be found in ./config/intellij. Copy them to the
root directory and your're ready to go.

Documentation
-------------
* See the Hammer wiki at http://wiki.github.com/benwazza/hammer
* Simple examples of use can be found in ./src/demo.
* The Hammer build in ./src/self is the best place to go for more complex
* examples.

Layout
------
* All source files are split up into their components under the 'src' dir.
* All generated files including class files go into the 'gen' directory.
  This directory is deleted by the 'clean' target.
* Open ./gen/artifacts/index.html for an overview of the main project
  reports and generated files.
* All build reports can be found in the ./gen/artifacts/reports/ directory.
* The self contained zip and tar.gz distributions of hammer are built into
  the ./gen/artifacts/nstalls/ directory.
* The individual jars including source can be found in the
  ./gen/artifacts/jars/ directory.
* All Hammer dependent jars are located under the ./lib/ directory.
  The quality related tols jars such as junit, jmock, simian jars are *not*
  required for running Hammer in your project unless your code depends on
  them.
