Hammer Readme
==============

Building
--------
JDK 6 or greater required.

Unix: ./build.sh
Win:    Somebody write one!

The build can also be run from IntelliJ by running the 'all' run
configuration. See below for Intellij config files.

IntelliJ
--------
Intellij project files can be found in config/intellij. Copy them to the
root directory and your're ready to go.

Documentation
-------------
* Simple examples of use can be found in src/demo.
* The Hammer build in src/self is the best place to go for more complex
* examples.
* See the Hammer wiki at http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/hammer_build for more
  info.

Layout
------
* All source files are split up into their components under the 'src' dir.
* All generated files including class files go into the 'gen' directory.
  This directory is deleted by the 'clean' target.
* The self contained zip and tar.gz distributions of hammer are built into the
  'gen/artifacts/dist/' directory.
* hammer.jar is the one you will need in your own projects if running hammer
  in an embedded manner. It can be found with the other jars in the
  'gen/artifacts/jars/' directory.
* All Hammer dependent jars are located under the 'lib' directory.
  The quality related tols jars such as junit, jmock, simian jars are *not*
  required for running Hammer in your project unless your code depends on
  them.
