Hammer Installation
===================

UNIX
----

Set HAMMER_HOME to location of your Hammer base directory.
For development you can set it to the boostrap directory of
your project checkout.

eg HAMMER_HOME=/usr/share/hammer

Then add $HAMMER_HOME/bin to your PATH

If you wish to use Ant tasks you must ensure ANT_HOME points
to the base directory of an Ant installation.

Remember to source your environment files after adding the above!

Check your install by changing into the 'sample' directory of
your Hammer installation and running the small sample build contained
there.

eg.

$> cd $HAMMER_HOME/sample
$> hammer

You should see some output echoed to the terminal.
